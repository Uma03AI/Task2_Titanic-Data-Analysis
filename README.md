# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of an AI & ML Internship Task 2. The goal is to perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using the Titanic dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

Understand the dataset using:
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization
- Pattern recognition
- Feature-level insights

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📁 Dataset

Dataset used: [Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Histogram**: Age distribution of passengers
- **Boxplot**: Age vs Survival
- **Countplot**: Gender vs Survival
- **Correlation Matrix**: To identify relationships
- **Pairplot**: (optional) For pairwise features

---

## 🧠 Key Observations

- **Women had higher survival rates** than men.
- **Younger passengers** had better chances of survival.
- **Higher-class passengers (1st class)** were more likely to survive.
- **Fare and Pclass** had a significant influence on survival.
